# GOVERNMENT-FUND-TRACKING-SYSTEM
GOVERNMENT FUND ALLOCATION AND TRACKING SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN
Introduction
This project aims to build a Government Fund Allocation and Tracking System using Blockchain Technology. The system ensures transparency, security, and accountability in government fund management. By leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain, all transactions become immutable and traceable, reducing the risk of corruption and mismanagement.

Features
Immutable Blockchain Ledger: All transactions are recorded on a blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent.
Smart Contracts: Automate fund releases based on predefined conditions.
Real-Time Fund Tracking: Monitor the allocation, distribution, and usage of funds in real time.
Comprehensive Audit Trail: Provides a full history of fund movements for auditing purposes.
Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles like administrators, auditors, and beneficiaries for secure access management.
Decentralized and Secure: Decentralization ensures security, with no single point of failure.
Technology Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric for smart contracts and decentralized ledger.
Frontend: React.js / Angular for building the user interface.
Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask or Django) for server-side logic and APIs.
Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL for off-chain data storage.
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 / JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js
Truffle (for Ethereum blockchain)
Ganache (for local blockchain network)
MongoDB / PostgreSQL (optional for off-chain data)
